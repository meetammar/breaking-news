The plugin helps you mark any Post as Breaking News easily.

== Description ==
- The `Breaking News` plugin allows the admin to mark any post as Breaking News. On plugin activation, the admin can manage plugin options in Settings->`Breaking News`.
Alternatively, the plugin settings can be accessed directly from this URL:
wp-admin/options-general.php?page=bns-settings

- A meta box will be visible on the sidebar of the add/edit Post page. Admin can mark any post as Breaking News that will be displayed in the header on the frontend.
An expiry date can be added to a Breaking News, enabling which the Breaking News will be removed from the frontend once the selected DateTime is passed. In case the admin marks another Post as Breaking News, the previous one will be removed and the last one will be activated.

== Installation ==
- After login to the admin panel, click on Plugins->Add New
- Click on `Upload Plugin` and upload the `Breaking News` build-in zip format.
- Click Submit and activate the plugin after that
You are all Done!
